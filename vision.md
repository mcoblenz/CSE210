Based on the data you gathered in the requirements elicitation session, your group should work together to establish a shared vision for your project.

Adapted from Prof. Bill Griswold's previous CSE 210:

Write a vision statement on a product that you think will be attractive in the marketplace (solve a "problem" for users) and will be affordable to build. What problem will you solve for your users? 

What are the main features you expect to deliver?
Identify who your customers are and how you'll reach them. Identify other stakeholders - partners, etc. Identify competitors.

Identify the factors (risks) that may lead to the failure of the product, including competitors.

Construct a plan to resolve the most serious risks. This must include dealing with any competitors. How will your product differ from existing products on the market?

Propose a general plan for technology you will use. Will it be a web app, or a native app? Which browser will you focus on, or which platform will you support? What main technologies do you plan to use? You should choose based on appropriateness for the application you're building as well as the skills that your team already has and wants to acquire. 
The result should be a two-to-six page ``vision document'' for the product. It is probably too early to address the schedule (more than what is here).

Because we don't have a separate phase where risks are identified (and new ones can be discovered at any time), it is important here to identify your top risks for the project and product. Include not only customer and competitor risks, but all major risks as you can anticipate them now. Three categories of risks to never forget are team, technology, and time. Finding all your risks is a creative activity requiring full team participation, e.g., brainstorming.
