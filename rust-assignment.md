You can submit your assignment via Gradescope here and it will be auto-graded. You can submit as many times as you like before the deadline. 

If you note any issues with the assignment, either in the README or the code, please post on Piazza. 

If you have any questions about the assignment, please post them on Piazza. If they are questions that do not reveal any of the answers (e.g. about Rust concepts), please post them PUBLICLY! This gives other students an opportunity to learn from and answer your questions!

For in-depth questions related to your code in particular, please attend office hours. We cannot help you debug via Piazza or email!
