## Deadlines

Deliverables are generally due on the Friday of each week before class.

* Week 0: team matching survey
* Week 1: no project deliverables
* Week 2 (due **Wednesday, 1/25**): Requirements elicitation questions
* Week 3: Vision document
* Week 4: Design mockup and requirements document
* Week 5: Sprint 1
* Week 6: Sprint 2
* Week 7: Sprint 3
* Week 8: Sprint 4
* Week 9: Demos


Starting week 3, weekly individual reports will be due, summarizing individual contributions to the team project. 

Starting week 5, teams should assign the following roles each week. These roles must rotate so that each member has an opportunity to have as many roles as possible during the quarter: 
    * Scrum master
    * CI/CD maintainer
    * Product owner
    * Report manager
    * Designer
Some team members may not have an assigned role in a given week; those team members can focus on completing tasks from the backlog.


At the end of each sprint, teams will submit sprint completion reports. These reports will summarize the tasks that were completed that sprint. They will also summarize the sprint retrospective meeting, describing what went well, what did not go well, and what changes the team will make for the next sprint. Teams must meet with their assigned TAs weekly to demo their progress.

TAs will provide feedback to groups telling them to what extent they're on track in different categories. Example categories might include:
    * Implementation
    * Process: CI/CD pipeline. 
    * Management/teamwork
    * Quality/testing 

### Project Topic

Housing in San Diego presents significant challenges to residents. Your project should concern some aspect of finding and choosing places to live in the area. Some possible challenges include:

* Identifying and comparing apartments or houses
* Landlord reputation
* Utility costs and/or environmental implications of various housing options (some housing stock may be poorly insulated and have high HVAC costs / energy consumption)
* Proximity to and accessibility of nearby services: grocery stores, restaurants, parks, libraries, etc.
* Group housing planning: people may want to live near friends or family

You may also identify other challenges related to housing or living in San Diego. 

### Team and Project Organization

Your team should follow an Agile process using scrum. Each week, you will be responsible for one of the following roles:

* Product owner (one per week)
* Scrum master (one per week)
* Development team member (allocate from the following as needed)
    * Developer
    * Tester
    * Designer
    * Technical writer

You should have at least four synchronous scrum meetings per week, which you should schedule in advance on different days.

Communication is your biggest risk, since you probably have disparate schedules; this mutates into a coherence/consistency risk, amongst others. You've been warned!

### Teamwork

Teamwork may be the most challenging part of the class. You will be working with teammates with whom you may not worked before and who may be different from you in ways that are hard to predict. Learning to work effectively in diverse teams is a *learning goal* of this class. It's okay if it's challenging! 

The course staff are here for you to help you work through and problems you may encounter. We want everyone to have a positive experience. To that end, students and staff will follow the [UCSD Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html) and the [Nondiscrimination Policy](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/policies-procedures/nps_student.html). Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. 

It is always easier to address challenging interpersonal situations early rather than letting them fester. If you encounter any situation that makes you feel uncomfortable or that you think should have gone differently, please contact any member of the course staff right away. When appropriate, we will try to resolve issues within the context of the course; after all, teamwork is a learning goal! However, if necessary, we may contact the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.ucsd.edu) or the [Office for Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination](https://ophd.ucsd.edu). Please be aware that **both TAs and faculty members are considered [responsible employees](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/resources/Responsible-Employee-FAQs.pdf) and are required to report incidents of sexual  harassment to [OPHD](https://ophd.ucsd.edu).**

Each member of the team brings unique skills, experiences, and interests. This diversity can lead to challenges. For example, one member of your team may be an expert in a technology that the team is using, while another is unfamiliar with that technology. Contributions will be judged according to individual starting points: a small contribution from a member who is new to a particular technology may be an "A"-level contribution when accompanied by appropriate learning. A larger technical contribution or, alternatively, mentoring other members of the team, may be expected from team members who are already experts at that technology. When assigning roles to team members, teams must consider individual learning goals in addition to team technical objectives.
