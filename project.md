## Deadlines

Please see the Calendar for the due dates.


Starting week 3, weekly individual reports will be due, summarizing individual contributions to the team project. 

At the end of each sprint, teams will submit sprint completion reports. These reports will summarize the tasks that were completed that sprint. They will also summarize the sprint retrospective meeting, describing what went well, what did not go well, and what changes the team will make for the next sprint. Teams must meet with their assigned TAs weekly to demo their progress.

TAs will provide feedback to groups telling them to what extent they're on track in different categories. Example categories might include:

* Implementation
* Process: CI/CD pipeline. 
* Management/teamwork
* Quality/testing 

### Project Topic

Health and wellness are challenges for everyone. Your team should choose a health or wellness-related issue that addresses the needs of key stakeholders. Then, design a software system that could help. Possible topics could include:

* Nutrition
* Exercise motivation and tracking
* Chronic condition management (e.g., diabetes, blood pressure, etc.)
* Medication tracking
* Meditation
* Specific exercise training (e.g., yoga or other exercise activities)
* Social connection

### Team and Project Organization

Your team should follow an Agile process using scrum. Starting week 5, you will be responsible for one of the following roles:

* Product owner (one per week)
* Scrum master (one per week)
* Development team member (allocate from the following as needed)
    * Developer
    * Tester
    * Designer
    * Technical writer

You should have at least three synchronous scrum meetings per week, which you should schedule in advance on different days.

Communication is your biggest risk, since you probably have disparate schedules; this mutates into a coherence/consistency risk, amongst others. You've been warned!

### Teamwork

Teamwork may be the most challenging part of the class. You will be working with teammates with whom you may not worked before and who may be different from you in ways that are hard to predict. Learning to work effectively in diverse teams is a *learning goal* of this class. It's okay if it's challenging! 

The course staff are here for you to help you work through and problems you may encounter. We want everyone to have a positive experience. To that end, students and staff will follow the [UCSD Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html) and the [Nondiscrimination Policy](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/policies-procedures/nps_student.html). Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. 

It is always easier to address challenging interpersonal situations early rather than letting them fester. If you encounter any situation that makes you feel uncomfortable or that you think should have gone differently, please contact any member of the course staff right away. When appropriate, we will try to resolve issues within the context of the course; after all, teamwork is a learning goal! However, if necessary, we may contact the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.ucsd.edu) or the [Office for Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination](https://ophd.ucsd.edu). Please be aware that **both TAs and faculty members are considered [responsible employees](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/resources/Responsible-Employee-FAQs.pdf) and are required to report incidents of sexual  harassment to [OPHD](https://ophd.ucsd.edu).**

If you observe behavior that might make someone uncomfortable but are not the target of the behavior, and you have standing to speak up, it is *your responsibility to do so*. If you don't feel comfortable doing so, please set up a meeting with course staff to discuss the matter and make a plan.

Each member of the team brings unique skills, experiences, and interests. This diversity can lead to challenges. For example, one member of your team may be an expert in a technology that the team is using, while another is unfamiliar with that technology. Contributions will be judged according to individual starting points: a small contribution from a member who is new to a particular technology may be an "A"-level contribution when accompanied by appropriate learning. A larger technical contribution or, alternatively, mentoring other members of the team, may be expected from team members who are already experts at that technology. When assigning roles to team members, teams must consider individual learning goals in addition to team technical objectives.
