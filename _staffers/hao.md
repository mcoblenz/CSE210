I am a UCSD undergraduate alumni (graduated in 2019) and I have worked as a mobile backend software engineer at ServiceNow for 3 years before I came back for a master's degree. My focus is mainly in Systems and Software Engineering, and I am most proficient in Java. I am very excited to work with all of you and learn together throughout this course!
