## About

CSE 210 is a first course in software engineering. Relative to some other CSE courses, it is unusual:

* The course emphasizes *group* work: half your grade will come from your contribution to your group, rather than individual work. You may do *different* work from other people in the class, and that's okay! The goal is for you to serve your group as effectively as possible.

* The group work will be not be graded primarily on the basis of your technical accomplishments (although that will be a factor). Instead, the emphasis will be on using the techniques presented in class to further the creation of software that benefits users.

* In some classes, spending large amounts of extra time can benefit projects. However, software engineering is about *predictability*. A software team that works 12-hour days for a period of time can ship great software once --- and then disband due to burnout, never to ship software again. We will ask you to budget and report on your group work time. More is not necessarily better. Of course, less is not better either!

Some students may have significant prior experience in software engineering. If this is the case for you, I invite you to *both* leverage your past experience *and* use the class as an opportunity to try out new methods.

This is my first time teaching this course, and I have made significant changes compared to other versions of the course. I ask for your patience and flexibility as I adapt the course design during the quarter. I reserve the right to make changes --- both to content and to grading policy --- to make the course work best for everyone. I encourage you to give feedback to me or the TAs throughout the quarter so we can make the course a great learning environment for everyone.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Work effectively in a team that uses an Agile development process.
2. Design and document software systems according to stakeholder needs.
3. Implement and debug complex software systems.

## Grading

I spent eight years as a software engineer in industry, and in considering hundreds of candidates for hire, I never looked at anyone's grade in a software engineering course. Neither, as far as I knew, did anyone else in the hiring process. Instead, we interviewed candidates to assess their skills and knowledge.

In this course, we have limited staff resources for giving feedback and grading work. There is also evidence from research showing that when students are given *both* long-form feedback *and* grades, students tend to focus on the grades, missing learning benefits of leveraging the feedback. Combined with my experience that knowledge and skills are much more important than grades, I have decided to focus the course staff time on providing *substantive feedback* and *opportunities for revision* rather than providing extremely precise grades (e.g., minus one point for a misspelling on page three). 

* 50% of your grade will be determined by your contributions to your group. However, we will *not* assess the technical merits of each project and assign the same grade to each contributing member. Instead, you will report weekly both on your own contributions as well as your teammates' contributions. Your contribution will be assessed in the following categories (this list may be updated as needed):
  * Technical contributions: to what extent has your technical work (writing code, designing software, writing documentation, writing tests, maintaining CI/CD systems) helped your team deliver great software?
  * Teamwork: to what extent have you been a collaborative and effective team member? Have you delivered what you promised in a timely fashion, and communicated as needed when you were running late?
  * Independence: to what extent have you provided *direction* to your group or exercised individual discretion? This category could also be called *leadership*, but this is not a competition to be the group "leader." Instead, our focus is on your ability to think critically about the team's needs and propose directions -- either techical or otherwise.

* 50% of your grade will be determined by your individual work on homework assignments and reading responses. We will provide written feedback on your work. In addition, each assignment will be marked with either **OK** or **resubmit**. Assignments marked **resubmit** should be resubmitted after addressing the feedback that is given in order to receive credit for completing the work. If the resubmitted work passes the quality bar, you will receive a grade of **OK** for that assignment. The actual quantitative grade will be determined according to the number of assignments you have submitted that pass our quality bar. To get an A, you must achieve **OK** on all of the assignments.

If you submit individual work late, we will not directly penalize your grade. However, we only commit to promptly grading and returning work that is submitted on time. Other work will be graded (and awarded credit) as resources allow.




## Lecture

Class meets at 9 AM MWF. I'm sorry about the early start. If it makes you feel any better, the registrar originally scheduled us for 8 AM, and I said no!

Discussion and participation in exercises is an instrumental part of the class. To promote free discussion (since students may want to discuss experiences they had at internships, etc.) as well as active attendance, class will not be recorded. You may not use recording devices to record class unless you have an OSD-approved disability accomodation (in which case any recordings are for personal use only).

If you are sick, please do not come to class. Instead, if you are feeling up to it, contact me and I can give you a Zoom link to use that day. No need for a doctor's note; we're all adults here.


## Academic Integrity

Teamwork and collaboration are critical to success in software engineering. In individual homework assignments, I ask students to follow a *whiteboard policy*: you may discuss the homework assignments with anyone you like in front of a whiteboard. However, after you are done, erase the whiteboard, and each student should write their own submissions. You must write the names of those you collaborated with in your submissions.

In team projects, all forms of collaboration are permitted within teams. Work between teams should follow the whiteboard policy above. Teams may not use each other's code or other artifacts.

When writing software, you may make use of resources to which you have legitimate access. For example, you may leverage open source projects or GitHub Copilot. However, it is *your* resopnsibility to vet these tools to ensure the quality of the software you are delivering. Importantly, **you must adhere to any licensing restrictions** for any software you use. For example, if you use GPLv3 code in your project but do not give your code a GPLv3 license, you are stealing someone's work and may be subject to an academic integrity violation report. Note that for this reason, GPL code can typically not be used in commercial projects, and you may want to choose a more permissive license. Licensing should be one of the earliest discussions you have with your team. If this policy seems harsh, keep in mind that licensing mistakes can lead to very expensive lawsuits.

The [default license](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for a software project is that no one else can use artifacts from that project. If you use code from a project that does not have a license, or you use code without appropriate attribution, you are in violation of a software license's terms and therefore violating this course's academic integrity policy. 

We recognize that you are not lawyers (neither are we!). Therefore, we will exercise reasonable judgment provided any problems are corrected immediately (typically by adding attribution or by removing the copied artifacts from your repositories). We reserve the right report academic integrity violations for egregious cases (e.g. use of another team's code or repeated violations).

## Assignments

Major individual assignments will be as follows:

* Human-computer interaction: applying basic methods of HCI to design and assess user interfaces

* Architecture: designing, analyzing, and documenting how components relate to each other and affect the quality attributes of the system.

* Debugging: you will contribute to an open-source project of your choice to fix a bug.

* Project reflection: at the end of the quarter, you will reflect on your role in your team and your team's dynamics.

Major group assignments will include:

* A "Hello, world" assignment in which you show that your team has a basic application working on your selected platform

On days when a reading is assigned, a *reading reflection* will also be due. This is an opportunity for you to think more deeply about the reading material and how its lessons might impact your software engineering practice.
