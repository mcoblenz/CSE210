## Discussion 

We will be using [Piazza](www.piazza.com) for discussion; we will enroll students from the waiting list as well.

## Schedule

Class will be MWF 10:00 - 10:50. Class meets at 10 AM MWF in [Center Hall](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/163044) 113.

Discussion and participation in exercises is an instrumental part of the class. To promote free discussion (since students may want to discuss experiences they had at internships, etc.) as well as active attendance, class will not be recorded. You may not use recording devices to record class unless you have an OSD-approved disability accomodation (in which case any recordings are for personal use only).

If you are sick, please do not come to class. Instead, if you are feeling up to it, contact me and I can give you a Zoom link to use that day. No need for a doctor's note; we're all adults here.

We will have a final exam on Friday, March 22 8 AM - 11 AM.

## Grading

* 40% of your grade will be determined by your team project. Of this 40%, part will be determined by team-level signals of quality, which will be assessed in weekly meetings with TAs and with team deliverables. The remaining part will depend on our assessment of your individual contributions to your group. For this portion, we will *not* assess the technical merits of each project and assign the same grade to each contributing member. Instead, you will report weekly both on your own contributions as well as your teammates' contributions. Your contribution will be assessed in the following categories:
  * Technical contributions: to what extent has your technical work (writing code, designing software, writing documentation, writing tests, maintaining CI/CD systems) helped your team deliver great software?
  * Teamwork: to what extent have you been a collaborative and effective team member? Have you delivered what you promised in a timely fashion, and communicated as needed when you were running late?
  * Independence: to what extent have you provided *direction* to your group or exercised individual discretion? This category could also be called *leadership*, but this is not a competition to be the group "leader." Instead, our focus is on your ability to think critically about the team's needs and propose directions -- either techical or otherwise.

* 40% of your grade will be determined by your individual work on homework assignments and reading responses.

* 20% of your grade will be determined by your final exam.

If you submit individual work late, we will not directly penalize your grade. However, we only commit to promptly grading and returning work that is submitted on time. Other work will be graded (and awarded credit) as resources allow.

## Academic Integrity

Teamwork and collaboration are critical to success in software engineering. In individual homework assignments, I ask students to follow a *whiteboard policy*: you may discuss the homework assignments with anyone you like in front of a whiteboard. However, after you are done, erase the whiteboard, and each student should write their own submissions. You must write the names of those you collaborated with in your submissions. 

In team projects, all forms of collaboration are permitted within teams. Work between teams should follow the whiteboard policy above. Teams may not use each other's code or other artifacts.

When writing software, you may make use of resources to which you have legitimate access. For example, you may leverage open source projects or GitHub Copilot. However, it is *your* resopnsibility to vet these tools to ensure the quality of the software you are delivering. Importantly, **you must adhere to any licensing restrictions** for any software you use. For example, if you use GPLv3 code in your project but do not give your code a GPLv3 license, you are stealing someone's work and may be subject to an academic integrity violation report. Note that for this reason, GPL code can typically not be used in commercial projects, and you may want to choose a more permissive license. Licensing should be one of the earliest discussions you have with your team. If this policy seems harsh, keep in mind that licensing mistakes can lead to very expensive lawsuits.

The [default license](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for a software project is that no one else can use artifacts from that project. If you use code from a project that does not have a license, or you use code without appropriate attribution, you are in violation of a software license's terms and therefore violating this course's academic integrity policy. 

We recognize that you are not lawyers (neither are we!). Therefore, we will exercise reasonable judgment provided any problems are corrected immediately (typically by adding attribution or by removing the copied artifacts from your repositories). We reserve the right to report academic integrity violations for egregious cases (e.g. use of another team's code or repeated violations).

## Reading assignments

On days when a reading is assigned, a *reading reflection* will also be due. This is an opportunity for you to think more deeply about the reading material and how its lessons might impact your software engineering practice.
